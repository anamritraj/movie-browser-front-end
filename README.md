## What?
This is a Movie Browsing front-end application made using Reactjs, which uses an API to get data from backend. 

## Why?
This was a developed for a hiring challenge organized online by a company. Haven't heard back from them since a while so thought maybe it will be of use to someone who may be developing some kind of a UI which resembles this.

# Getting Started
This application is crafted using create-react-app. So you only have to run two commands after cloning this repository on your local machine.
```
npm install
```
and then,
```
npm start
```
